    <h3>Items</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100 gm toor daal</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
            <li>1 handful curry leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>3 washed & dried red chilli</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Steam cook the lentils or the dal. Do not add too much water. Only add the amount of water required to let the dal cook properly. Mudda pappu means daal which is not too liquid in consistency.</li>
            <li>Add a tadka of mustard seeds, cumin seeds, red chilies and curry leaves in a little oil to this dal. If you like tomato, add tomato to the tadka, and let the tomato cook for a while and then transfer the tadka with tomato into the dal.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste. Mix the dal along with the tadka in such a manner so that all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>What complements the mudda pappu is a little bit of ghee, along with piping hot rice and avakaya (mango pickle).</li>
        </ol>
