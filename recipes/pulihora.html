        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Pulihora is an authentic Andhra delicacy. The word 'puli' is derives from 'pulupu' which means sourness and 'hora' which is derived from 'origamu' which indeed means food or meals in telugu language. The sourness in the recipe come from tamarind or lemon or mango. In Andhra Pradesh, pulihora is commonly referred to as poor man's festival food. Pulihora is a combination of salty, hot, sour and spicy tastes (all at a time). It is considered to be a good stimulant for a dull appetite. Pulihora can be carried to picnics or on long distance travels.</p>

        <h4>Steps to make</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin making the Andhra Style Pulihora Recipe (Spicy & Tangy Tamarind Rice), first get all the ingredients ready. Using precooked and day old rice where the grains are separated makes the Pulihora come out with great textures.</li>
            <li>Heat sesame oil to a heavy bottomed pan and when the oil gets heated up add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dry red chillis, green chillis, curry leaves and saute until the seeds start crackling and the chilies are roasted.</li>
            <li>Add the turmeric powder, asafoetida powder, jaggery, the tamarind pulp and salt. Cook the tamarind pulp in the seasoning for at least 4 to 5 minutes over medium heat until the raw taste from the pulp goes away and the pulp has thickened up.</li>
            <li>Once the pulp is cooked, add the cooked rice and peanuts and stir to combine all the ingredients well. Cover the pan and allow the Andhra Style Pulihora to absorb all the flavors from the tangy masala.Once done, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste. Finally drizzle some more sesame oil over the Andhra Style Pulihora and stir to combine.This adds an additional flavor to the dish.</li>
            <li>Once done, transfer to a bowl and serve.</li>
            <li>Serve Andhra Style Tamarind Rice on its own with Elai Vadam and serve it for lunch or even pack into your lunch boxes along with a glass of chaas. </li>
